#

1. BUG FIXING
-------------

1.1 Processing

- Modify processing.py to import std_modis_monavg module (The processing services was stopped for UoG/IOC - reported by TPZF).
- Modify loop_eumetcast_ftp() in get_eumetcast, to update 'processed_list' (files copied continuously - found out at ToT Nairobi).
- In ingestion, do the merge to output files only for 'tile' type (e.g. PML) and work in tmp_dir (rather than output_dir).
- Make more robust conv_list_2_string() for error check.
- Avoid duplications in 'input_files' metadata tag - for ingestion of 'tile' products.
- Modify get_internet/get_eumetcast.py to re-direct log output (2.0.3-6)
- Modify get_internet to delete tmpdir in case of errors (2.0.3-8)
- Modify get_internet to go to next source in case of error (2.0.3-10)
- Modified internet source for TAMSAT (tamsat.org.uk) (2.0.3-11)
- Modified ingestion for check creating tmp_dir (2.0.3-11)
- Make more robust ingestion service by raising more exceptions (2.0.3-11)

1.2 Visualization

- Correct GetProductLayer() in webpy_esapp.py to save legend steps as float, rather than int (problem with Chla legend=83 at ToT Nairobi)
- Under the Acquisition page in unlocked situation, when editing a EUMETCAST but not saving, the edits remain in cache also when doing a refresh of the Acquisition page.
  (Resolved by disgarding changes when clicking on Cancel and adding the eumetcast and internet datasource stores to the refresh).
- Under the Acquisition page in unlocked situation, when editing an Internet data source description, the changes are now saved in the DB on Save (there was a bug due to a datatype issue).

1.3 Configuration/DB

- Assign write permissions on their desktop to adminuser and analyst. Changed in .rpm.
- THEMA change updates also the table product_acquisition_datasource in the database.

1.4 Packages (pre-post inst)

- Correct the Docs.rpm to display the correct French documentation
- Create /data/ with correct permissions (Apps.rpm rel. 2.0.3-6)
- Stop/Start services during installation (Apps.rpm rel. 2.0.3-8)
- Add a line to rc.local to delete all tmp dirs at reboot (Apps.rpm rel. 2.0.3-8)
