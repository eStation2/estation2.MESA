#	Procedure to generate the update_insert_jrc_data.sql file
#   ==========================================================

In the products schema there is the function called export_jrc_data(full_copy) that generates the content of
the update_insert_jrc_data.sql file according to the below rules.
Run the function as follows:
    SELECT FROM products.export_jrc_data(TRUE);
    or
    SELECT FROM products.export_jrc_data(FALSE);

Copy the result a paste it in a temprary file. Open update_insert_jrc_data.sql and copy paste the sql at its right place.

Tables that MUST NOT be 'full-copied':

pads, processing, ingestion, process_products 	-> depends on THEMA 
products					                    -> depends on THEMA

Specific actions - like removing a processing chain or correcting a record - can be done on single records


Tables that CAN be 'full-copied':
												NOTE
datasource_description 		-> in case of correction/patches			can be changed by Users in the interface
sub_datasource_description 	-> in case of correction/patches			can be changed by Users in the interface
eumetcast_source		    -> in case of correction/patches			can be changed by Users in the interface
internet_source			    -> in case of correction/patches			can be changed by Users in the interface

mapset				        -> in case of correction/patches			cannot be changed by Users in the interface

Tables that ARE always 'full-copied':
												NOTE
legend,legend_steps 		-> truncated at the beginning of the update .sql


#   ==========================================================
#	Procedure used to set 'activated' according to THEMA
#   ==========================================================

The 'thema_product' table is used to activate/de-activate products in the following table:

products                                    (according to product/version)
pads                                        (according to product/version)

ingestion                                   (according to product/version/mapset)
processing+process_products                 (according to product/version/mapset)

Actually the approach was different until and after version 2.1.0

In version 2.0.4: the set_thema() function is called at the end of postinst and does everything
In version 2.1.0: the newly defined products (see list below) are manually 'de-activated' and activated by function:

    products.activate_deactivate_product_ingestion_pads_processing
