#	Script to reset all bucardo definitions: it is called during an upgrade, in order to have a clean starting point for the definition of new syncs, which 
#	should include the NEW added tables.		
#	Subsequenty, the bucardo_config.sh will be called by the 'System' services
#	Usage: bucardo_reset.sh <role>  (role is pc2 or pc3)
#	NOTE: The script has to be run after:
#			a. bucardo installation 
#			b. configuration of the network (and namely creation of hosts mesa-pc2 and mesa-pc3)
#			c. assignment of the PC role (as pc2 or pc3)
