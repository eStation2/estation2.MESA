#   Release Note for 2.0.4
#   Changes with respect to 2.0.3-12 - Unless specification, they refer to Apps.rpm package.
#

1. BUG FIXING
-------------

1.1 Acquisition

- Correct the ingestion of product MPEG-MPEF, which failed - from time to time - resulting in files copied to /data/ingest.wrong (see Tuleap #11144)
- Modify the eumetcast source description for MODIS Chla product from EUMETCast and ingest pre-processing type, following change from .bz2 to .nc format (see Tuleap #10903)
- Correct get_eumetcast_ftp (reflecting modifications in get_internet)

1.2 Processing

- Modify existing processing chains (lsasaf_et and _lst) to: 1. Save file checkpoints to a separate .sqlite and 2. change checksum_level = 0.
  This is to avoid re-computations at every run.

1.3 DataManagement

- Creation of archives from request (see Tuleap #11146): 1. a separate file (_0001.bsx) is created for each sub-products (before the same file was overwritten)
  2. The file decompress.sh is added under apps/productmangement/installer

1.4 Visualization

- For visualizing correctly Chla legends, define explicitly the decimal separator type in webpy_esapp:GetProductLayer() - see Tuleap #10904

1.5 Service

- Correct the DB dump in the System Service (see Tuleap #10905)

1.6 Configuration/DB

- correct regular expressions for g2 NDVI, FAPAR, DMP, LAI, FCOVER products in order to exclude SOAM region


2. NEW FEATURES
---------------

2.0 General

- Modifications to manage a 'proxy': 1. Define functions._proxy_defined() to read definition from factory_settings.ini
  2. In case of proxy, change the urllib2 options to test internet access.

- Changes of get_internet: 1. In case of proxy, change the parsing of ftp-response. 2. Re-organize/rename/clean functions' naming.
  3. Implement the management of type=http (similar to ftp, but for http servers)

- New processing chains for MODIS-FIRMS (with ICPAC), MSG-MPE (with SADC)

- All log files viewable from the Dashboard, Acquisition and Processing pages are now shown in reversed order with the latest
  date on top so that the user does not need to scroll down to see the latest log entries.
  Also all the log files (.log, .log1, .log2, etc...) are concatenated to avoid that former messages are not displayed (because they are moved to .log1).


2.1 Dashboard
- Finished the dashboard information for installation type SinglePC.


2.2 Acquisition/Processing/DataManagement
- In the Acquisition page under the 'Product' column the source of each product is shown.
- The internet source for FEWSNET-RFE is modified
- Small correction in the get_internet.py to manage the case of no-files found for a source.
- Use shutil.move rather than os.rename to move files to 'archive' dir (safer)

2.3 Visualization/Analysis
- Vector layer administration is added to the analysis tool.
  The User can upload/import its own vector layers and change a layer's definition and draw properties like line color and thinkness.
  Each layer can be enabled/disabled to be shown in the vector layer menu in a Mapview
  Each layer can be activated to be openend automatically in a Mapview.
- The source of each vector layer is shown in the add vector layer menu in a Mapview.
- By default zoom to the max extent of the selected vector layer.
- Added to the product legend, the legend name and unit. Ex: Rain (mm), Temperature (°C), Dry Matter (kg/ha), etc.
- Outmasking a product in a Mapview over any selected multi-polygon.
- Saving a map as .PNG now contains also the legend within the .PNG image.
- Doubleclick on a feature (polygon) will zoom to its extent.
- On Mapview mouseout the highlighted feature (polygon) is removed.
- Time series graph draw properties management added.
- Time series sum aggregation of for example Fire or Water occurences.
- New Legends are added, and some modified, especially to have more coherent definitions across products.

2.4 Configuration/DB
- Added one table called "layers" for layer registration and their draw properties, in the schema analysis.
- Added one new table called "chart_drawproperties" for the time series chart draw properties, in the schema analysis.
- Added new columns to the table "timeseries_drawproperties", in the schema analysis.
- Updated the function "analysis.update_insert_timeseries_drawproperties" and created 2 new functions for the above mentioned new tables.
  New functions are "analysis.update_insert_layers" and "analysis.update_insert_chart_drawproperties".


2.5 Other packages
- It is decided not to update the eStation2-Layers package, rather to create new ones for additional layers, namely:

    eStation2-Layers-a0: Modified ICPAC levels 0/1/2
    eStation2-Layers-a1: New CongoBasin0..3, AfricaBasin1..3
    eStation2-Layers-a2: New IGAD levels 0/1/2
    eStation2-Layers-a0: Level 00 for Africa and the seven RICS

- eStation2-Docs package is updated to 2.0.4, by changing the Product Report to V.1.2
