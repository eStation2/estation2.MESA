1. BUG FIXING
-------------

1.1 Acquisition

- Activating a product did not activate the defined get/ingest/processing: correct it through a function in the DB.

1.2 Processing

- MODIS MON-AVG: Change the computation, so that it does not work on the current month (MOI request).
- Issue with modis_par 4 km processing chain: two versions (2012.0 and 2013.1) existing in process_products table (MOI request)??
- Primary Production computation not triggered (MOI request).
- In the std_ndvi chain apply baresoil masks to ndv and ndvi-linearx2 anomalies (was missing)


1.3 DataManagement

- Made the rendering of dataset completeness chart more robust (sometimes it did not display properly).
- Statistical derived subproducts (with date format MMDD) were shown as 34 files in completeness instead of 36 files.
- Change the User Interface loop to avoid error of an existing product w/o any get/ingest/processing defined.
- Harmonize the products naming/definition in products table
- Data set completeness adjustment for frequency types e15minute, e30minute and e1day by passing a from_date.


1.4 Visualization

- Correct the display of the timeline to MMDD products (e.g. 10d average)
- Replace the greenwich time-series computation with a direct gdal-python call (the greenwich used version does not support some polygons, nor points/lines)
- Ensure the bar charts are equally distributed in the graphs of type 'Profile'

1.5 Service

1.6 Configuration/DB



2. NEW FEATURES
---------------

2.0 General

2.1 Dashboard

2.2.1 Acquisition

- Add the Copernicus Global Land (CGL) 2.2 version for NDVI (SPOTV/PROBAV) in netcdf format, and prepare for version 2.0.1
  of LAI/FCOVE/FAPAR (not yet activated)
- Add ingestion for ARC2-rain daily product - 0.1 degree - GZIP type
- Add ingestion of CPC Soil Moisture monthly product - 0.5 degree - binary type (new pre-proc type)

2.2.2 Processing

- In the std_precip processing chain, add the 3/6/12 months cumulation and anomalies (for FEWSNET, TAMSAT, ....) and ratio
- In the std_modis_irms (active fires) processing chain, add the grid-computation (10k FTTB)
- In the std_ndvi chain a sub-product is added (ratio-linearx2)
- Modify cumulation period of the msg-mpe product from 6:00 AM to 5:45 AM of the next day (BDMS request, to match gauge meas).
- Modify the MSG-MPE processing chain in order to delete the tmp dir (and call 1dcum only for n_files >86). Furthermore, a unique logfile is used.

2.2.3 DataManagement

2.3.1 Visualization/General

- Implement the User login (to allow saving of the analysis 'templates')
- Save.restore the Analysis templates (for Maps only - FTTB)

2.3.2 Visualization/Maps

- Add the option to draw and save polygons, lines and points (for computing TS)
- Add the animation of the selected time period ('movie' option)
- Add for the User the option to 'fine-tuning' the zoom level
- Add the possibility to define all Maps graphical properties (to be saved in the template), e.g. size/position, title, disclaimer.
- Improve visualization of the logos
- Add a data disclaimer

2.3.3 Visualization/Graphs

- Add the 'Cumulative', 'Ranking/Z-score' and 'Matrix' types of graphs (on top of the existing one, renamed 'Profile')
- Organize the subproduct list, under each product, according to the time lag category (1d, 10d, 1 month, ...) so to facilitate the User selection

2.4 Configuration/DB

2.5 Other packages

- Integration of the 'Geoportal' module into eStation2-Apps.
